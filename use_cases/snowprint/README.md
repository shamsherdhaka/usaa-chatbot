## Structured Data & Use Cases
This repository contains a **fictional dataset** from _Snowprint AG_. The dataset is split into three core tables that capture different aspects of the companyâ€™s printing operations:

1. **Customers**  
   Stores client information such as name, contact details, location, and phone numbers.  
   Example use: Identifying customer segments by country or city, generating targeted marketing campaigns, or pulling up client contact details on demand.

2. **Jobs**  
   Tracks printing jobs with columns for job name, priority, due date, and completion status.  
   Example use: Monitoring overall job status, identifying high-priority tasks, or finding overdue projects.

3. **Steps**  
   Details the step-by-step process for each job (e.g., _Prepare_, _Printing_, _Quality Checks_) along with timestamps.  
   Example use: Analyzing production workflows, calculating turnaround times for each step, or optimizing bottlenecks.

### Possible Business Use Cases

- **Customer Relationship Management**: Quickly view customers by region or generate lists of pending orders.
- **Production Tracking**: Identify high-priority jobs, check which steps are completed, or spot delays in real time.
- **Performance Analytics**: Calculate average lead times, track overall productivity, and improve scheduling and resource allocation.
