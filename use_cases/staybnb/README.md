## Use Case Deployment
Execute this SQL Query to create and run the notebook in your account which will generate data and required services.
```sql
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE FROM @CORTEX_AGENTS_DEMO.PUBLIC.GITHUB_REPO_CORTEX_AGENTS_DEMO/branches/main/use_cases/staybnb/_internal/setup.sql
  USING (BRANCH => 'main', EXECUTE_NOTEBOOKS => TRUE) DRY_RUN = FALSE;

## Structured Data & Use Cases
This repository contains a **fictional dataset** from _StayBnB_. The dataset is split into two core tables that capture information about properties and bookings:

1. **Homes**  
   Contains data about property type and total square meters.

2. **Bookings**  
   Contains information about booking dates, nightly rates and cleaning fees.  

In addition to that we also have image data of properties available. These images are analyzed via a multimodal LLM to extract the room type and the available appliances.
This leads to a third table:  

3. **RENTAL_HOME_ROOMS_STRUCTURED**  
   Contains the rooms and all available appliances per room per home.  

## Unstructured Data & Use Cases
Each property has a description that includes information about the surrounding location, the outdoor area, the host, etc.

## Example Questions
